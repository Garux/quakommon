/*QUAKED _decal (0 1.0 0) ?
-------- KEYS --------
target : The name of the entity targeted for projection.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.

/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4)
-------- KEYS --------
angle : Rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
angles : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
_scale : Scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

/*QUAKED func_bobbing (0.2 .4 .6) ? X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that oscillates back and forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the brush in the axis in which it's bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis (up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the "noise" key is set. Will crush the player when blocked.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : Sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32).
phase : Sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : Path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (e.g. sound/world/drone6.wav - see notes).
-------- SPWAN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
targetname : Used to attach a misc_model entity to this entity.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs : (OR _castshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs : (OR _receiveshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- MODEL KEYS --------
model2 : Path/name of model to include (.md3 files only, e.g. models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : Alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound and .md3 model included with entity (see notes).
light : ConstantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : ConstantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : Entity will bob along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : Entity will bob along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

/*QUAKED func_breakable (0.2 .6 .6) ?
A breakable thing just sits there, doing nothing, 
but will break if damaged or collided with.
-------- KEYS --------
type : 0: glass 1: wood 2: ceramic 3: plastic 4: metal-normal 5: metal-explosives 6: metal-hk69 7: stone-explosives 8: stone-hk69 9: wood-explosives 10: wood-hk69(SEE NOTES)
axis : 1 - x, 2 - y, 4 - z
health : health of object
shards : number of shards object should shatter into (0-255)
bombable : allows the entity to be destroyed by the bomb in bomb mode. The size of blast shown when the entity breaks is determined by this value (Values : 1 none - 255 huge blast).
-------- MODEL KEYS --------
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
color : constantLight color
light : constantLight radius
-------- NOTES --------
 - For glass windows that break easily, set health to 1.
 - Any func_breakable with a health of less than 10 will slowly weaken if a player is in contact with it.  You can make a roof that collapses in after a period of time by setting the health to a value like 5.  This will mean that a player standing on such a surface for around 5 seconds will fall thru.  The effect is cumulative: if you stand there for 3 seconds and then come back you can only stand on it for another 2 seconds.
 - The type parameter selects the shader that is used for fragments and sets the sound the object makes when it breaks.
 - If the brush you are making is on an angle (for example, a skylight in a sloping roof) then you will need to set the break axis to "4" if you want it to break when people stand on it.
 - You can build anything to break using the breakables. You can make a model breakable without having to use the model2 key. Just right click with it selected and choose func_breakable.
 - Set shards as high as you want (it maxes out at 32 anyway) - players can reduce the number of shards they see using cg_maxFragments
 - Bombable key is to be used for things that can only be broken by the Bomb Mode bomb explosion. For example a large propane tank near a bomb target. The key's value will determine the size of the explosion graphics from this entity when broken, with a value of 1 being no explosion and a value of 255 being a large secondary blast.
 - Type values info for 1,2,3,4 - The game will attenuate the damage caused by each hit to a value of 1-3. Health values above 10 will choose a random health between 6 and 10. Specifics are as follows: 0: is for glass/windows 1: is for all woods 2: is for ceramics and pottery 3: is for various plastics 4: is for metal that can be broken by normal means
 - Type values info for 5,6,7,8,9,10 - The game will use the literal health value compared to the weapon damages. They should be set quite high (metals and stone at 50+). Specifics are as follows: 5: is for metal that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 6: is for metal that requires the hk69 to break 7: is for stone that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 8: is for stone that requires the hk69 to break 9: is for wood that requires explosives to break (HE grenade or hk69) 10: is for wood that requires the hk69 to break

/*QUAKED func_button (.5 .3 0) ?
When a button is touched by a player, it moves in the direction set by the "angle" key, triggers all its targets, stays pressed by an amount of time set by the "wait" key, then returns to it's original position where it can be operated again.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : Determines the direction in which the button will move (up = -1, down = -2).
angles : (Alt to angle) Advanced angle control. This sets the pitch, yaw and roll aiming angles of entity (default 0 0 0)

speed : Speed of button's displacement (default 40).
wait : Number of seconds button stays pressed (default 1, -1 = return immediately).
lip : Lip remaining at end of move (default 4 units).
health : If set to a non-zero value, the button must be damaged by "health" amount of points to operate.
push_sound : Sound that gets played when button gets pushed ("none" for nothing, defaults to a elevator Q3 sound).
-------- SPAWN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

/*QUAKED func_door (.5 .3 0) ? START_OPEN
Normal sliding door entity. By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : Determines the opening direction of door (up = -1, down = -2).
angles : (Alt to angle) Advanced angle control. This sets the pitch, yaw and roll aiming angles of entity (default 0 0 0)
speed : Determines how fast the door moves (default 100). See notes about using speed key to make door teleporters.
wait : Number of seconds before door returns (default 2, -1 = return immediately).
lip : Lip remaining at end of move (default 8).
targetname : If set, a func_button or trigger is required to activate the door.
health : If set to a non-zero value, the door can be damaged by "health" amount of points to activate (default 0).
CloseWhenIdle: When set to 1, the door will close as soon as there are no players in the triggering brush (For CTF Spawn Room doors, SEE NOTES!) (There is still a mini delay before closing)
trigger_only : Set to 1 if the door can only be opened by a switch or trigger (ie: prevents a player from opening it manually)
team : Assign the same team name to multiple doors that should operate together (see notes).
only : Set to allow only one team to use this entity, used for CTF or other respawn type modes to create spawn rooms. Values: blue or red - Default: anyone
pos1 : Sound to play when door starts moving ("none" for nothing, defaults to a creak)
pos2 : Sound to play when door stops moving ("none" for nothing, defaults to a creak)
noise : Looping sound as door is moving
-------- SPAWN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs : (OR _castshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.

_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- MODEL KEYS --------
light : ConstantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : ConstantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : Path/name of model to include (.md3 files only, e.g. models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : Alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (see notes).
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------

_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OPEN : The door will spawn in the open state and operate in reverse.
CRUSHER : Door will not reverse direction when blocked and will keep damaging player until he dies or gets out of the way. (CRUSHER don't work in UrT)
-------- NOTES --------
To use the CloseWhenIdle setting for CTF Spawn Room doors, you must also set trigger_only, and use a trigger_multiple to open the door. This will cause the door to remain open only as long as a player is in the triggering brush.  Set the 'wait' key on the trigger_multiple to a very low value( < 1 like .25 )
If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. 
Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname"). And you can connect a button with target it to open it and a model to target it to connect the model to it and have the model be opened by the button.

-------- DOOR TELEPORTERS -------- (Simple explanation)
If a object is set to move so fast that it moves from 1 of it points to the other in an instant and hits the player in it's travel it will "teleport" the player.
This teleport will move the player the full length of the brush that hits it, no matter where in it's travel it hits.
It will also keep the player speed and direction travelling.
lip: key can influence travel distance so keep this at 0 for easy distance calculation.
CloseWhenIdle: tend to have a mini delay before it it returns back so it is often suboptimal to use.
Instead use a target_relay and a target_delay set to wait 0.1! that then targets this entity and set wait to -1.
Warning: If end destination is inside a solid object the player will get stuck in door without teleporting!
Warning 2: Wall running can trick the game to think you would endup in a door, same with curved walls/ramps. (Make sure to always test for this just!)

-------- NOTES --------
Rotating doors cannot be shot open, and will only close or open if activated by a player.  They will not automatically close after a period either.  In game modes not listed under either gamemode_open or gamemode_shut, the doors will open and close normally.

You construct a rotating door just like a FUNC_ROTATING: it needs an origin brush to act as the hinge.

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: Pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

/*QUAKED func_plat (.5 .3 0) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Determines how fast the plat moves (default 150). See notes about using speed key to make door teleporters.
lip : Lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : If set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
//dmg : Damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : If set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.

_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

If a object is set to move so fast that it moves from 1 of it points to the other in an instant and hits the player in it's travel it will "teleport" the player.
This teleport will move the player the full length of the brush that hits it, no matter where in it's travel it hits.
It will also keep the player speed and direction travelling.
lip: key can influence travel distance so keep this at 0 for easy distance calculation.
CloseWhenIdle: tend to have a mini delay before it it returns back so it is often suboptimal to use.
Instead use a target_relay and a target_delay set to wait 0.1! that then targets this entity and set wait to -1.
Warning: If end destination is inside a solid object the player will get stuck in door without teleporting!
Warning 2: Wall running can trick the game to think you would endup in a door, same with curved walls/ramps. (Make sure to always test for this just!)

/*QUAKED func_rotating (0.2 .4 .6) ? - - X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that rotates continuously. Rotates on the Z axis by default and requires an origin brush. It will always start on in the game and is not targetable.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Determines how fast entity rotates (default 100).
noise : Path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (e.g. sound/world/drone6.wav).
-------- MODEL KEYS --------
model2 : Path/name of model to include (.md3 files only, e.g. models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).
origin : Alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default 0 0 0 - see notes).
light : ConstantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : ConstantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
-------- SPAWN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
targetname : Used to attach a misc_model entity to this entity.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs : (OR _castshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs : (OR _receiveshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : Entity will rotate along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : Entity will rotate along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. It will rotate along the Z axis by default. You can check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: It will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

potential spawning position for Urban Terror.

group : this spawn groups with others of same groupID. A team chooses spawns from a certain group. 
g_gametype : a list of gametypes on which to use this spawn eg: "3, 5, 6"

You would use the groups key in maps if you wanted to make sure a team will spawn together in a certain location, so you might take 8 spawn points, give them all gametypes of "3, 5, 6, 7, 8" (all teamplays except gametype 4 TS, gametype 4 should be in separate groups for each team) and then assign all eight a group id of "1" then you might do another eight and make their group id all "2". Then do the same for the other team e.g.: 8 spawns for both red and blue teams with group 1 and another 8 spawns for both red and blue teams with group 2. UT will choose a "group" at the begining of a round and spawn all members of the "teams" there. Normally you'd have a few groups of spawns so you could have lots of potential team starting positions. Note: The game treats TS (gametype 4) spawns differently. It chooses the spawns based on furthest distance from each other rather than in paired groups. So if you wanted two spawn areas for each team you would do team blue group 1, team red group 2, team blue group 3, team red group 4.

/*QUAKED misc_portal_camera (1 .5 .25) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SLOWROTATE FASTROTATE NOWOBBLE
Portal camera. This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angles" key or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: This sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.
target : Point this to a target_position entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
targetname : A misc_portal_surface portal surface indicator must point to this.
roll : Roll angle of camera. A value of 0 is upside down and 180 is the same as the player's view.
-------- SPAWN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SLOWROTATE : Makes the portal camera rotate slowly along the roll axis.
FASTROTATE : Makes the portal camera rotate faster along the roll axis.
NOWOBBLE : Stops the camera portal from wobbling. Q3A point release 1.32 only.
-------- NOTES --------
Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the camera. However, the target_position method is simpler. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle. If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then the "roll" value is irrelevant.

/*QUAKED target_speaker ( 0.15 .4 .8 ) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : Path/name of .wav file to play (e.g. sound/world/growl1.wav - see notes).
wait : Delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see notes).
random : Random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see notes).
targetname : The activating button or trigger points to this.
-------- SPAWN KEYS --------
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
gametype : Specifies gametypes to play the sound in. If this key is not used, sound will play in all gametypes. List types in this format: 01234
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : Sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : Sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : Sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : Sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
Notes:
LOOPED sounds are globally loaded meaning even if no player is in the active area the sound will not reset.
Where as if you do use a combination of 'wait' and 'random' key the entity is not globally loaded and will be reset if no player is in the area to key the entity loaded.

Mr. Sentry is designed to be used in conjunction with CTF Spawn Rooms (see the Notes on the func_door entity) to prevent enemy team players from surviving if they enter the opposing team's spawn room. Even though the properly set up doors will generally prevent this, Mr. Sentry also has one other function. It will kill any Flag Carrier that enters it's range no matter what team that player is on. This will prevent players from grabbing the flag and retreating the the complete safety of their Spawn Room and waiting out the rest of the map time with the flag.

For the anti-flag-camp feature to work properly, the entire spawn room must be enclosed with a 'nodrop' (a brush with the 'nodrop' texture on all sides). If this brush (or group of brushes) isn't placed, then Mr. Sentry will kill the Flag Carrier, and the flag will remain at that location, which is bad.

// WORLDSPAWN ENTITY
//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : Text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : Path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (e.g. music/sonic5.wav). [Disabled in UrT!]
_ambient : (OR ambient) Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default 0 0 0).
gravity : (Don't use this!) Gravity of level (default 800 = normal gravity). [Do NOT put this at anything other then 800 or messes with gravity for server on other maps!!!] Use trigger_gravity instead!
enablePrecip : 0 - (default) none, 1 - rain, 2 - snow
precipAmount : up to 1024, number of drops/flakes
gridsize : Granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : Q3Map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density (default 1024 1024 0, 0 values = disable). 
-------- JUMP MODE KEYS --------
stamina : JUMP MODE KEY! Automatically controls g_stamina for certain jump servers. Defaults to 1.
Note: This key only has an effect on certain jump servers and not offline/devmap, for now.
overbounces : JUMP MODE KEY! Turns off overbounces for certain jump servers. Defaults to 0.
0 = All overbounces disabled!
1 = Overbounces enabled. Overbounces will happen unless you use either ‘-noob’ compile (on bsp) or use ‘surfaceparm noob’ (common_ob/noob)
Note: This key only has an effect on certain jump server and not offline/devmap, for now.
walljumps : JUMP MODE KEY! Automatically controls g_walljumps for certain jump servers. Defaults to 3.
Note: This key only has an effect on certain jump servers and not offline/devmap, for now.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_floodlight : RGB distance intensity eg; .8 .8 .8 512 32. Adds radiosity lighting.
lightdensity : New key that allows the mapper to brighten the textures more than is possible normally. You can test this in game by starting a devmap and using /r_lightdensity 1.3 (or whatever value you like).
_color : RGB value for ambient light color.
globalfog : RGB density eg: .25 .25 0 0.00001 Adds a soft global haze. Not to be used for convential fog. This can be tested in game by starting a devmap and using r_fogdensity "0.0001" r_fog_r ".25" r_fog_g ".25" r_fog_b ".25". (Not working in UrT?)
_minlight : Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Does not add, unlike ambient.
_minvertexlight : Minimum vertex lighting, levelwide.
_mingridlight : Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.
_noshadersun : Ignore q3map_sun/sun directives in sky shaders and ONLY use entity sun lights.
_farplanedist : Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.
_foghull : Shader to use for "fog hull". Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in the world. Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities) (default 1.0).
_cs : (OR _castshadows ) Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs : (OR _receiveshadows) Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix. Overridable in entities.
_styleNalphaGen : *IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNalphaGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5) [Disabled in UrT 4.2/3!]
_styleNrgbGen : *IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNrgbGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values take standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5) [Disabled in UrT 4.2/3!]
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
